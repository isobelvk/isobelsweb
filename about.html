                <h4>"my name isoooobel / married to myself / my love isobel / living by herself"
                    <br></h4>
                if you know those lyrics... i think we might be good friends. i was named after that song!!
                <br><br>
                anyway, i think you know my name already. i make music and i'm truly a creative at heart. i've been involved in music in some capacity my whole life. as a kid, i would mess around on garageband on my mom's ipad. later, in middle & high school, i found myself enveloped in various choirs. choir taught me many of the fundamentals of music theory, which i carry into my writing today. most importantly, it trained my ear--which is pretty much how i learn everything in music.
                <br><br>
                i started writing, producing, and recording music when i turned 17 in quarantine. i always wanted to make music, but i had this idea implanted in my head that some producer was supposed to find me. i guess i didn't think that girls could produce music too. one day, i stumbled upon another artist my age who produced their own music and i realized i could i give it a shot. i made stuff all day, everyday. i wouldn't even open the curtains in the morning. at this time, i also started to seriously play guitar. i technically started playing when i was 11 but i hadn't touched my guitar since. later on, i picked up some bass and a little keys. i'm not very good though. 
                <br><br>
                the best way i can describe my music is soft rock, bubblegrunge, melody-driven, indie-pop. if that sounds like your style, be sure to check me out.

                <h2>so what made me want to code a website?</h2>
                <hr color="yellowgreen">
                <p>well... i guess i long for a time before the internet was infested with cororpate greed and spam. by extension i'm interested in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Internet_theory" style="color: goldenrod;">dead internet theory</a> (there's a lot of crap if you look into it, so minus all that). i guess i believe in some abstraction of it--like the internet has lost its personality. everything is just too centralized now. anyway, in short, i believe we should revive the personal web. it's a unlimited avenue for self expression, unlike the formatting and customization boundaries that social media posits. i also just wanted to learn something new, and coding seemed cool.</p>
