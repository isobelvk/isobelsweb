                    <h2>november 26, 2024 - on <i style="color: tomato;">scarlet</i></h2>
                    <p>
                        dear reader,
                        <br><br>
                        i wanted to write a bit about my second ep/album, <i style="color: tomato;">scarlet</i>. i’m not sure if it’s an ep or album yet purely by length; it’s seven tracks, so something in between. i’m hoping the producer i collaborate with, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/0RZtAmDno2JtPGBCfUjUOy?si=bdabOzK8S1qNl7iCVe6qpQ">kidlucky</a>, will send me another beat or two to write over and add to the project. before this project everything of mine was self-produced - something i take great pride in. i remember telling my manager way back when that i wanted my first project to be self-produced, and then i’d consider working with other producers after. it ended up happening that way organically.
                        <br><br>
                        kidlucky dmed me saying that my “insta link doesn’t work” from my soundcloud about a year ago. from there he sent me his demos and we started to talk about music. this may sound a little condescending but what surprised me about him was i liked his music - a rare occurrence for me in the diy music community. he sent me the instrumental “sober sally” and i knew i had to hop on asap. well, first i ignored his message for five days (coincidentally mirroring one of the original lyrics in the song) and then i started writing as soon as i listened. it came naturally too - i wrote and recorded the demo in about two hours and sent it back. from there, he would send me instrumentals and i would send something back within a few hours or the next couple of days. “sober sally” is about two characters, a boy and a girl, hopelessly intertwined in drug use. the boy is high all the time and subsequently doesn’t show that he cares about the narrator. the narrator hurts themself to get this guy’s attention. if these were tv characters, they’d be jesse and jane from breaking bad. “sober sally” is one of my favorites from the bunch.
                        <br><br>
                        another one of my favorites is “undercover.” my girlfriend showed me the song “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG1VVFfOnYQ&ab_channel=Pitchfork" target="_blank">hot knife</a>" by fiona apple a couple months before writing it. i was very inspired by the knife-and-butter metaphor, so i appropriated it. i also wanted to capture the sensuality of bjork’s “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqneaw3Vrzk&ab_channel=Bj%C3%B6rk-Topic" target="_blank">cocoon</a>” - a song i grew up with. “undercover” was written in 15 minutes over a facetime call with my best friend. he was doing his work while i mumbled to myself, scrambling down words. i then quickly hung up and recorded the demo. the lyrics, concept, and everything about that song came so intuitively. it felt like the song was already there; i just unveiled it. i wanted to capture the idea of a childhood love - your childhood best friend, or your first love. i feel it’s most evident in this verse in the song:
                        <br><br>
                        “you play your tricks, what sticks gets stuck
                        <br>
                        through thick and thin, a string i pluck
                        <br>
                        when we were kids and lighting stuck
                        <br>
                        it hit your head, your heart conducts it through
                        <br>
                        right through
                        <br>
                        in two
                        <br>
                        my love runs through you”
                        <br><br>
                        this verse, and the idea behind the song, also capture the concept of the project. the “string” i’m referring to both the strings of the guitar i play and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_thread_of_fate" target="_blank">red string theory</a>, a belief in chinese folklore that two people who are destined to meet each other are tied together by a red string. i often feel like the people i meet, especially those important to me, are people who are fated to be in my life. i think that’s true for other people too. i believe in the red string theory - or at least i’m fond of the idea of it. “undercover” was also written right before a family trip to china to see family and my mom’s hometown. i listened to it on repeat there, and the images i associate with it are all videos and photos i took on that trip. to me, “undercover” is on a rainy day covered by umbrellas, in the ancient town in 绍兴 or by the beautiful west lake in 杭州. “undercover” is getting late-night ramen outside a busy fluorescent street and biking home in the chinese countryside. if it were a movie, it would be <i>your name</i> decorated with imagery from <i>chungking express</i>. scarlet is the red string theory, and i’m excited about it as a project. it’s a real gem - a no-skip album if you will. those songs feature some of my best storytelling and lyricism. working with another producer made me realize where i shine best: as a singer-songwriter. i want to keep writing songs that capture the same magic as the songs from <i>scarlet</i>. maybe i’ll go into a bit more depth about some of the other songs in a future blog post.

                    <h2>november 25, 2024 - welcome 2 my blog</h2>
                    <p>
                        dear reader,
                        <br><br>
                        welcome to my blog. i’ve decided to explore a new creative avenue: long-form writing! after all, one of my favorite things to do is write - god, you should see my journals. i’ve kept a journal since i was in kindergarten. most of them are collecting dust in the basement, but i keep my most recently relevant journals in my room. i wish i could post some of the entries, poems, and songs from my journals here, but everything i’ve written is a mess of poetic nothings about my deeply personal affairs. i’ll flip through, however, and see if there’s anything non-descript enough worth sharing for the future.
                        <br><br>
                        anyway, we’re in the heart of autumn - nearing the end, actually. the leaves continue to undress the trees and outside it smells like firewood and sugar maple. a week ago, i cut my hair, and feel like a new me - someone excited for life. i’m super stoked about putting out my ep. it just sounds so good. there are still many things i could nitpick about it but overall, i’m satisfied. still gotta go through mixing and mastering, however. lately, i’ve been sketching some artwork for singles. i don’t know why i didn’t think of doing the art on my own earlier - i’ve always loved drawing. here are some single artwork sketches i’ve been working on:
                        <br>
                        <div class="container">
                        <img src="../images/hot shit art Medium.jpeg" width="30%">
                        <img src="../images/id do art Medium.jpeg" width="30%">
                        <img src="../images/laundry art Medium.jpeg" width="30%">
                        </div>
                        <br>
                        **my art style is super inspired by adventure time if you can’t tell.
                        <br><br>
                        i’m thinking of mixed media for singles and a drawing alone for ep art. in my head, boyish is blue - a tale of a midwestern teenager coming to grips with the reality of adult love and life. a coming-of-age story, if you will. the final track on my ep, “aubrey,” was one of the first few songs i ever wrote. it’s crazy to think that it’s finished and will be officially released. it’s also probably the song i’m least in love with - i guess i just outgrew it. a couple of friends of mine told me they liked the original demo more than the new version. i feel like the original holds a special place in my friends’ hearts. it does for me too, but when i listen to it now, i cringe. i did my best with the new version so it is what it is. i like it, i just don’t love it like i do my punky ballads, “hot shit” and “i’d do.” those two are gold. i listen and i get stank face. shit rocks.
                        <br><br> 
                        that’s all i’ve got for today. cya.
