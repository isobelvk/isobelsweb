                at the time of writing this, i was very dissatisfied with life. it's hard to say i'm satisfied even now. but that's what laundry is about. every week felt like rinse and repeat, which is a feeling i often circle back to usually come january.

                sometimes i feel like i'm all talk and no show. but maybe i'm not even talk, hence "no bark, no bite." i actually intended on changing that golden retriever line but i decided not to stray from the original demo. i wrote the entire thing in a haste.

                <div id="annotation3" class="annotation" style="display:none;">
                    crimson lips = facade, sour kiss = bitter reality. this line is about being a little disillusioned with life.

                <div id="annotation4" class="annotation" style="display:none;">
                    this lyric highlights the anticipation of turning 20 and the responsibilities that age entails. maybe you feel like you're outgrowing the care you receive in life, and maybe you still crave it.

                    another lyric i wanted to change because i felt like it sounded a little corny... but sometimes corny gets the message across best. sometimes i feel so wrapped up in myself that i don't show up for the people i care about, like my little sister.

            </span>
            <div id="annotation7" class="annotation" style="display:none;">
                "cut my tears in two": you're just splitting your tears in half, creating more tears. if crying is such a crime, i'll just cry more about it.
            </div>
            <span class="lyric" onclick="toggleAnnotation('annotation8')">
                <mark>‘cause i, i wash and dry<br>to make my life worth the time</mark><br>
            </span>
            <div id="annotation8" class="annotation" style="display:none;">
                this is a return to the laundry metaphor with some silver lining. the song felt like it needed a resolution & i tried to look at the monotony of life from a different point of view. maybe the things you do every day make your life worth living.
