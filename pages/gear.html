                    this was a generous gift from my neighbor in 2022. i play it everyday and it's the reason why my music sounds the way it does.

                    bought this used from the guitar center online store in 2021. it was a gamble since i had never played it. it was the best decision i made cuz it was reasonably priced, had like no flaws, and i do everything on it.

                    got this in april of 2023. will be playing her more soon. i don't do anything crazy on bass but it's fun & i record my basic basslines on this. haven't changed the strings in forever though...

                    my first ever guitar. it was my grandma's. one of the strings snapped and i don't really play it anymore. just haven't bought the strings for it plus the action is way high.

                    bought this because my guitarist, and friend, drew, told me to buy it. i only started recording my amp because of him - otherwise i would just di it. needed this amp for playing shows too.

                    got this used when i first started making music and i barely used it. it's just quicker to play on my laptop keyboard when inspiration strikes.

                    a classic. can't go wrong with this one. i use it on my amp and acoustic sometimes but tbh i like condensors on acoustic.

                    got this in 2023 i think. i use this to record my amp signal and di signal at the same time. most of the time i never even use the di signal.

                    i was soo dumb for buying this but i use it a lot. the guy who sold me my amp didn't send the footswitch with it & i didn't even know those existed, so i bought this. my amp can simulate this.

                    the chorus on my amp wasn't cutting it for a song i was recording for release, so i bought this. i also don't think i really needed it... whatever. got it cuz i saw it was on king krule's gear list.

                    i was also kind of dumb for buying this. it was an impulse buy because i thought it would solve a tone problem in one of my songs. it didn't.
